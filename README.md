### Description:
You are an intern working at an office on a project, ***but the deadline is today!*** Finish the project while avoiding burnout to win!
The main premise of this game is to acknowledge stress and mental health in a relatable environment. Many who participated in this year's SparkHacks know the pressure of a project's deadline, and we wanted to convey the message of taking care of yourself in a fast-paced, stressful workplace. To finish the project on time and beat the game, you must complete your project by typing in words at your computer while managing your burnout meter, which increases while working. You can lower this burnout by stepping away from the screen and taking breaks. These are vital both in-game and in real life, and we hope to convey the importance of breaks while working.
