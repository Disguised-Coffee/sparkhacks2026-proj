## Description:
You've been assigned your first project at your new internship, ***but the deadline is today!*** Finish the project while avoiding burnout to win!

**Workaholic** is a short narrative game where you play as a computer science intern racing to finish an important project on the day of the deadline. As the clock ticks down, you must balance productivity with self‑care in a high‑pressure office environment.

The core gameplay loop centers on typing relevant work‑themed words at your computer to fill a project progress bar before time runs out. However, working too hard too quickly raises your burnout meter. To succeed, you’ll need to periodically step away from the screen and take breaks to bring your burnout back down.

Our goal with Workaholic is to _highlight the importance of mental health and sustainable work habits_, especially in tech-related and academic settings. Many participants in SparkHacks 2026 are familiar with tight deadlines and late‑night coding sessions; this game reflects that experience while encouraging players to recognize when they need to pause, reset, and return with a clearer mind — both in‑game and in real life.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** GDScript, HTML
- **Game Engine:** Godot
- **Art Tools:** Aseprite, Photoshop

<sub><sup>This was our first time working with Godot and Aseprite, and it was a huge learning experience for our entire team. We had a lot of fun (even if we were super stressed), and we plan to continue working on this even after SparkHacks! Our biggist regert was not researching our engine and art tools before jumping in, but our passion allowed us to persevere through even these struggles.</sup></sub>
